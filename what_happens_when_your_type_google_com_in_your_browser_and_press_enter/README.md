# What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` and Press Enter

## Project Overview
This project is a deep dive into the technical workflow that occurs when a user types a URL like "https://www.google.com" into their browser and presses Enter. It explores various components of the web infrastructure and how they interact to serve the requested webpage. This is a common interview question asked in software engineering positions to assess a candidate’s understanding of web technologies.

## Blog Post
I have written a detailed blog post explaining the following stages in the process:
- **DNS Request**
- **TCP/IP**
- **Firewall**
- **HTTPS/SSL**
- **Load Balancer**
- **Web Server**
- **Application Server**
- **Database**

The blog post covers how each of these components works together to load Google's home page when you make a request. You can find the full post on Medium or LinkedIn:

## Diagram
A diagram has also been created to illustrate the flow of a request when typing `https://www.google.com` in a browser. It covers:
- DNS resolution
- Request to the server’s IP on the appropriate port
- Traffic encryption
- Traffic passing through a firewall
- Load balancer distributing the request
- Web server responding to the request
- Application server generating the web page
- Database queries for dynamic data
